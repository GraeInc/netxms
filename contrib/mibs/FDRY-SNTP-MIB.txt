		MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
		STATUS  current
		DESCRIPTION
			  "An entry in the SNTP server table. This table uses running index as the Index to the table.
			  	Reasons to go for running index Scheme than IP addresses:
				1.	The table will be Virtual Routing and Forwarding(VRF) independent
					that multiple VRFs could share the same address type and address.
				2.	Index with address type and address could be potentially 17 unsigned integer, parsing and finding next index takes CPU time. 
					The PDU gets to be huge too! 
				3. 	IP address is just another attribute, they are supposed to be list of servers."
